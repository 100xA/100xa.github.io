So whats with this AI thing? Is it gonna replace my job as a software developer soon, or am I doomed to do this myself for a long time?

With the emergence of Devin from Cognition Labs, those questions seem to be more and more pressing.
As technical staff we often develop a different viewpoint on things, especially if it directly matters to us. <br>
<br>
This short essay is meant to explore the possibilities and shortcomings of "AIs" and technologies surrounding it from the perspective of a engineer, but for non-technical professionals. <br>
<br>
Often times those are the people who enact real managerial change, which is why it is so important to accurately inform them on the current technical trends, without relying too much on the hype.

## So what are those AIs anyways?

When we hear terms like AI and Machine Learning, we often get confused. GPT-3, DALL-E and Claude 2 are all generative AI models, meaning that they take raw data - say, all of Wikipedia or the collected works of Goethe - and "learn" to generate statistical probable outputs. <br> <br>

Generative models have been used for years prior in statistics to analyze numerical data. The rise of deep learning, however, made it possible to extend those capabilities to images, speech and other complex data types. <br> <br>

So no, in the current iteration, Generative AI cannot develop new capabilities beyond its reach or rather learned capabilities. While it can synthesize knowledge, and f.e write a paragraph of song lyrics in the style of Yukio Mishima, it only can mimic those styles and influences and not create its own.

## Why Devin?

A few days ago, Devin got announced. With Cognition Labs slogan of building the first "AI Software Engineer" plenty of VCs got excited, and many developers got scared. <br><br>

Devin can already pass Upwork Requests (which are usually reserved for Freelancers), it has an editor window where it can edit code, it has a browser window where it can interact with websites like GitHub, and it can read and make use of some documentation. The main thing seems to be the dedicated planning window, for how it approaches tasks. <br><br>
