# General Info

This is an updated version of [Project Zample](/2021/01/01/project-zample). Since Zample's code was outdated, I have updated it to the non-null standard provided by Flutter.

The project workbook was written for [NexLiber.com](https://nexliber.com).

# Technical Summary  

This is part one of a probably three-part series, meaning that this project only encompasses:
* General Setup (Seperation of BL, UI and Repo, project structure)
* Firebase Setup
* Firebase Auth (Google Auth)

The projects follows the same technical guidelines/processes as [Project Zample](/2021/01/01/project-zample).
