# World Bank Data Analysis Project: Development Process

## Project Overview
This project analyzed World Bank socioeconomic indicators from 2000 to 2019, exploring relationships
between factors like GDP per capita, fertility rates, and education levels across countries.
The analysis involved data preprocessing, including filtering out countries with insufficient data and using linear interpolation for missing values. Visualizations were created to compare pre- and post-interpolation data, correlations between indicators were calculated, and scatter plots were developed to illustrate relationships.
The R script was structured with clear sections and comprehensive comments, accompanied by a
README file for project overview and usage instructions. The development process included continuous testing and refinement, with adjustments to data cleaning methods and visualization techniques.
Challenges encountered included dealing with incomplete data, managing API limitations,
and selecting effective visualization methods. These were addressed through careful filtering, error handling, and experimentation with different plot types.
Future opportunities include expanding the analysis by incorporating additional indicators or extending the time range, with potential for more advanced statistical analyses in subsequent iterations.
