Hi, my name is Jan Biernacki. I am a 21 year old Software Developer from Germany. I have 4 years of experience in **Android/Cross-Plattform App-Development**, working mostly for/with startups: From planning, prototyping, interface design and backend design to full-stack development.

<br>

> I personally **strongly** believe in the importance of open source software. Being an almost exlusively self-taught developer, I prefer and **mostly use open source software to accomplish my daily tasks**. This belief also led me to discover the **unix environment**, where I set up personal projects.
